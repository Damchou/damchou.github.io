**Nth Year Student** is a resource management game where you play as a student from the university. You need plan your daily activities to balance your resources and study for the upcoming tasks and exams. There can also happen random events, depending on your location and your actions. Repository and download link possibly coming.

This is a game project for courses "_Introduction to Game Development Tools_" and "_Project Course on Game Development_" at the University of Turku. This was showcased in ICT Showroom 2021 (student project exhibition and competition) in Turku as a part of the latter course.

I've been programming mechanics, designing and developing the UI, and fetched some free sound effects for the game. I had the most Unity experience in the team so I also helped others with Unity-related issues and basics.

I learned to create more designer-friendly scripts for easier use of the inspector. UI was also my main focus in this project which improved my hierarchy-management (as the game was mostly UI, the hierarchy window was full of nested UI elements) and discovered Canvas Groups. This project improved my overall Unity expertise and I feel more confident using different aspects of Unity.
