<p><strong>Nth Year Student</strong> is a resource management game where you play as a student from the university. You need plan your daily activities to balance your resources and study for the upcoming tasks and exams. There can also happen random events, depending on your location and your actions. Repository and download link possibly coming.</p>

<p>This is a game project for courses “<em>Introduction to Game Development Tools</em>” and “<em>Project Course on Game Development</em>” at the University of Turku. This was showcased in ICT Showroom 2021 (student project exhibition and competition) in Turku as a part of the latter course.</p>

<p>I’ve been programming mechanics, designing and developing the UI, and fetched some free sound effects for the game.</p>
