<p><strong>Repair Ahoy</strong> is a singleplayer/local-coop game, where you have to repair broken stuff to advance to the next room. Complete all rooms before timer runs out to win.</p>

<p>The game was our (<a href="https://github.com/Half-Bent">Half Bent</a>) outcome in the <strong>Global Game Jam 2020</strong>. And it was also my first game jam. I helped <a href="https://github.com/sammuttaja">Anton Rautanen</a> with the code and did graphics for the game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re on a ship, trying to keep it afloat by fixing each room before the ship, you and the captain sinks. Player 1 uses WASD to move and Space to repair. Player 2 uses game controller’s left joystick to move and X/A to repair.</p>
